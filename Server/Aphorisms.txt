Cooperation, not competition, is the life of business.

Good business is business with profits for both sides.

A proper way to think of business is in terms of service.

Business that always runs smooth is running downhill.

If at first you don't succeed, ask yourself why.

Playing fair is worth more to a customer than a price cut.

Take your work seriously but don't take the office home with you.

He who has four and spends five, needs neither purse nor pocket.

A man is judged by what he spends, not by what he earns.

When it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.

It is easy to be liberal when spending another's money.

Concentrate, it saves time and money.

In business saving the pennies often means losing the pounds.

The better the service given to customers, the less it costs to serve them.
